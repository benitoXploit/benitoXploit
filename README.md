# 👋 Hey, I'm Benito

I'm a soon-to-be Cybersecurity student at Deakin University.  
Right now, I'm spending my gap months getting hands-on with ethical hacking, Linux, networking, and cybersecurity tools.

I'm using platforms like TryHackMe to learn by doing, and slowly building a portfolio of small but meaningful projects.
